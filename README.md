`For Task 1 and 3`: [Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation Methods for UW-OCTA Diabetic Retinopathy Grade Assessment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.13486.pdf)

The methods (MCSDR-Net v1) constructed by my team (Galactic Fleet) was placed 7th (0.5161 mDice) in the DRAC2022 Semantic Segmentation (Task1) challenge.

After the challenge, we improved the built model  (MCSDR-Net v1)  and proposed a second version  (MCSDR-Net v2) , which has greatly improved the accuracy of the model, reaching 0.5544 mDice.
